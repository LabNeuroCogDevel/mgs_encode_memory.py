3	Data Notes:
3	 1) X_Gaze and Y_Gaze are uncorrected gaze values (no smoothing, etc...).
3	 2) X_CorrectedGaze and Y_CorrectedGaze are corrected gaze values that may include smoothing, averaging, parallax correction, nudging, etc...
3	 3) Regions are calculated with respect to the corrected gaze values.
3	 4) PupilWidth and PupilHeight calculations are relative to which pupil segmentation method is active.
3	    a) Ellipse - PupilWidth is the major-axis (larger value) and PupilHeight is the minor-axis (smaller value).
3	       The major-axis and the minor-axis are both normalized by the width of the EyeCamera window so the scales of the axes are commensurable.
3	    b) Oval Fit - PupilWidth is the HORIZONTAL dimension and PupilHeight is the VERTICAL dimension of the rectangular bounding box of the unrotated Oval.
3	       The HORIZONTAL and VERTICAL dimensions are both normalized by the width and height of the EyeCamera window respectively so the scales of the axes are incommensurable (see manual for details).
3	    c) Centroid - PupilWidth and PupilHeight are 0, because no pupil size is obtained.
